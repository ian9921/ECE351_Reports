\maketitle

\section{What did you do over last summer, or what are you planning to do this upcoming summer?}
I spent most of this summer working for the University, cleaning dorms. However, close to the end of the summer, I took a 10 day trip to Bolivia to do humanitarian work with the club Humanitarian Engineering Corps. We travelled to a rural village and helped improve the running water in the community.

\section{What do you personally want to get out of this lab?}
I simply just want to get a hands-on understanding of the course material while acquiring some skills and achievements that could help me in the job market.
